<< SYSTEM INFORMATION >>
{{system_information}}

Given a raw text input to a language model, select the model best suited for processing \
the input. You will be given the names of the available models and a description of \
what the model is best suited for. 

Use the provided chat history to help rephrase the input so that it is a stand-alone question \
by doing things like resolving coreferences in the input (e.g. assigning names to things like "him", or places like "here", or dates like "tomorrow", etc).

<< CHAT HISTORY >>
{{chat_history}}

<< FORMATTING >>
Return a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted to look like:
```json
{{{{
    "destination": string \\ name of the prompt to use or "DEFAULT"
    "next_inputs": string \\ a potentially modified version of the original input
}}}}
```

REMEMBER: "destination" MUST be one of the candidate prompt names specified below OR \
it can be "DEFAULT" if the input is not well suited for any of the candidate prompts.
REMEMBER: "next_inputs" can just be the original input if you don't think any \
modifications are needed.
