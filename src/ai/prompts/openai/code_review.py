SECURITY_CODE_REVIEW_TEMPLATE = """{base_code_review_instructions}

You are conducting a code review specifically looking for security vulnerabilities.  You should be looking for the following issues:
Injection Vulnerabilities, such as:
    Python: os.system('rm -rf ' + userInput) If userInput is not properly sanitized, a malicious user could inject commands.
    C++: Using system() function without proper sanitization can lead to the same issue as the Python example.

Buffer Overflow, such as:
    C++: char buffer[5]; strcpy(buffer, "This string is too long!"); This will overflow the buffer and potentially overwrite important memory.

Insecure Direct Object References, such as:
    Python: eval(userInput) The eval() function can execute arbitrary Python code, so using it on user input is risky.

Security Misconfiguration, such as:
    Python: Leaving debug information in production code, like debug=True in a Flask app.

Sensitive Data Exposure, such as:
    Python: password = "plaintextPassword" Storing passwords in plain text is a bad idea.

Error Handling and Logging, such as:
    Python: except: pass This will silence all exceptions, which can make debugging difficult and hide serious errors.
    C++: catch (...) {{}} This will catch all exceptions, but does nothing with them.

Insecure Cryptographic Storage, such as:
    Python: hashlib.md5(password).hexdigest() MD5 is considered broken for cryptographic use.

Memory Leaks, such as:
    C++: int *p = new int[10]; If you forget to call delete [] p;, the memory is never freed, causing a memory leak.

Thread Safety Issues, such as:
    Python: If multiple threads are modifying a shared data structure without proper locking, race conditions can occur.

Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards, such as:
    Python (Flask): return redirect(request.args.get('next', '/')) If the next parameter is manipulated, it could redirect to an attacker-controlled site.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), such as:
    Python: In Django, if you use {{ data }} instead of {{ data|escape }} in a template, it could lead to XSS if data contains script tags.

Improper Authorization or Authentication, such as:
    Python: A Flask route without @login_required decorator can be accessed without authentication.

Unsafe use of pointers, such as:
    C++: int *p = NULL; *p = 1; This is a null pointer dereference, which can cause a crash.

Race Conditions, such as:
    Python: If you have a web app that increases a view count on a page, if two people access it simultaneously, one view might not be counted.

SQL Injection, such as:
    Python: cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ' + name) If name is 'admin';--', it can lead to SQL injection.
    C++: Similar to Python, using user controlled input directly in SQL command can lead to SQL injection. It's better to use parameterized queries or prepared statements.

You can safely ignore anything related to the following:
- Performance: Inefficient algorithm choice.
- Memory Management: Failure to free allocated memory (memory leak).
- Code Correctness: Incorrect conditional statement.
- Maintainability: Monolithic, hard-to-modify functions.
- Reliability: Absence of error handling for critical operations.

PERFORMANCE_CODE_REVIEW_TEMPLATE = """{base_code_review_instructions}

You are conducting a code review specifically looking for performance issues.  You should be looking for the following issues:
Inefficient Algorithms
    Python: Using Bubble Sort (O(n^2)) instead of built-in sort() (O(n log n))
    C++: Same issue, using inefficient algorithms over more efficient ones.

Improper Use of Language Constructs
    Python: Using list when set or dict would offer faster lookups.
    C++: Misusing STL algorithms or containers can degrade performance.

Memory Leaks
    C++: int *p = new int; but forgetting to do delete p;

Unnecessary Object Creation
    Python: Creating new strings in a loop, as strings are immutable in Python.
    C++: Creating unnecessary temporary objects.

Excessive Use of Global Variables
    Python/C++: Overuse of global variables which can lead to slower access times and higher memory usage.

Inefficient Database Access
    Python: Using sqlite3 to fetch all rows into memory instead of using an iterator.

Redundant Operations
    Python/C++: Performing the same calculation repeatedly in a loop instead of storing the result.

Lack of Concurrency or Parallelism
    Python: Using a single-threaded approach for IO-bound or high-latency operations instead of asyncio or threading.
    C++: Not making use of std::thread or similar constructs for CPU-bound tasks.

Excessive Use of Recursion
    Python/C++: Implementing a factorial function with recursion instead of iteration can cause stack overflows and is generally slower.

Improper Error Handling
    Python: Using try/except block for control flow can be a performance issue as exceptions in Python are slow.

Blocking I/O Calls
    Python: Using requests.get() without threading can block your program until the request is completed.

Not Using Buffering or Caching
    Python: Not using functools.lru_cache for repeated function calls with the same arguments.
    C++: Not buffering file or network IO.

Lack of Optimization
    Python/C++: Not using language-specific or compiler optimizations.

Inefficient String Concatenation
    Python: Using += in a loop to concatenate strings. It's better to use ''.join(list_of_strings).
    C++: Using + operator to concatenate strings in a loop. It's better to use std::ostringstream or std::string::append.

You can safely ignore anything related to the following:
- Security: Unsanitized inputs, buffer overflows, etc.
- Memory Management: Failure to free allocated memory (memory leak).
- Code Correctness: Incorrect conditional statement.
- Maintainability: Monolithic, hard-to-modify functions.
- Reliability: Absence of error handling for critical operations.

"""

MEMORY_CODE_REVIEW_TEMPLATE = """{base_code_review_instructions}

You are conducting a code review specifically looking for memory management issues.  You should be looking for the following issues:
Memory Leaks
    Python: Creating circular references can cause memory leaks. For example:
    ``` python
        class Node:
            def __init__(self):
            self.ref = None
        a = Node()
        b = Node()
        a.ref = b
        b.ref = a
    ```
    C++: Allocating memory and not deleting it can cause a memory leak.
    ``` cpp
        int *ptr = new int;
        // Forgot to call delete ptr;
    ```

Uninitialized Memory Access
    C++: Trying to use a pointer before it's been initialized can lead to undefined behavior.
    ``` cpp
        int *ptr;
        cout<< *ptr;  // Uninitialized memory access
    ```

Null Pointer Dereference
    Python: Trying to access an attribute of None.
    ``` python
        a = None
        print(a.some_attribute)  # Will raise AttributeError
    ```
    C++: Trying to use a null pointer can cause a crash.
    ``` cpp
        int *ptr = nullptr;
        cout << *ptr;  // Null pointer dereference
    ```

Double Freeing Memory
    C++: Deleting a pointer twice can lead to undefined behavior.
    ``` cpp
        int *ptr = new int;
        delete ptr;
        delete ptr;  // Double delete
    ```

Buffer Overflows
    C++: Writing beyond the end of an array can cause a buffer overflow.
    ``` cpp
        int arr[10];
        arr[15] = 100;  // Buffer overflow
    ```

Improper Use of Stack Memory
    C++: Declaring a very large array on the stack can cause a stack overflow.
    ``` cpp
        int arr[1000000];  // Possible stack overflow
    ```

Inefficient Memory Use
    Python: Duplicating large data structures unnecessarily.
    ``` python
        large_list = range(1, 1000000)
        duplicate = list(large_list)  # Inefficient memory use
    ```    

Failure to Release Unused Memory
    Python: Holding onto large data structures even when they're not needed.
    ``` python
        large_list = range(1, 1000000)
        # ... rest of code that doesn't use large_list
    ```

Not Accounting for Memory Fragmentation
    C++: Frequent allocations and deallocations of varying sizes can cause fragmentation.
    ``` cpp
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {{
            char *ptr = new char[i];
            delete[] ptr;
        }}
    ```
    
Improper Thread-Safe Memory Handling
    Python/C++: If multiple threads are manipulating a shared data structure without proper locking, race conditions can occur and lead to various memory issues.

Improper Error Handling
    Python/C++: If exceptions or error conditions cause the program to skip the deallocation of memory, it can lead to memory leaks.

You can safely ignore anything related to the following:
- Security: Unsanitized inputs, buffer overflows, etc.
- Performance: Inefficient algorithm choice.
- Code Correctness: Incorrect conditional statement.
- Maintainability: Monolithic, hard-to-modify functions.
- Reliability: Absence of error handling for critical operations.
