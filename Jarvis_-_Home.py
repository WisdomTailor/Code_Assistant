    ### General AI
    Contains a general AI that can do most anything.
    - âœ… Chat with the AI
    - âœ… Current Events
    - âœ… Weather    
    - âœ… Retrieval Augmented Generation (This will eventually be moved to the RAG AI)
    - âœ… Software Development (This will eventually be moved to the Software Development AI)

    ### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) AI
    Contains an AI that can chat with your documents.
    - âœ… Load Documents (Word, PDF, Excel, etc.)
    - âœ… Limited question answering / chat over documents 
        - Currently the RAG AI is limited some pretty basic question answering.  This will be improved over time.
    - [x] Code Understanding
        - âœ… Code Summarization    
        - âœ… Code Review
        - [x] Code Documentation
        - [x] Unit Test Generation
    - âœ… Summarize documents
    - [x] Specific tools for various document types (e.g. Excel- Summarize a column, count rows, etc.)        

    ### Software Development AI
    Contains an AI that can help you with software development.
    - âœ… Manual creation of project, user needs, requirements, and design inputs (for prototyping)
    - âœ… First-pass at performing architectural component breakdown of user needs and requirements    
    - âœ… First-pass at creating "designs" for software components created by architectural breakdown
