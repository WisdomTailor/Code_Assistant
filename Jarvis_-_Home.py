    ### General AI
    Contains a general AI that can do most anything.
    - âœ… Chat with the AI
    - âœ… Current Events
    - âœ… Weather    
    - âœ… Retrieval Augmented Generation (This will eventually be moved to the RAG AI)
    - âœ… Software Development (This will eventually be moved to the Software Development AI)

    Use this AI to chat with Jarvis, ask about the weather, or ask about current events.  
    You should also use this AI when loading your documents, such as Word, PDF, Excel, or other documents that you may want to chat with Jarvis about.

    ** Note: Currently the General AI is the only AI that can chat with your documents.  This will be moved to the RAG AI as soon as I get to it. **

    ### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) AI
